## Power/Influence/Interest Cube

A 3D extension for complex stakeholder landscapes:

| Dimension | Meaning | Assessment |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Power** | Formal authority | Can approve/block? |
| **Influence** | Informal sway | Can they convince others? |
| **Interest** | Level of concern | Do they care? |

**Why Add Influence?**
Some stakeholders have low formal power but high informal influence:

- Technical leads respected by teams
- Long-tenured employees with institutional knowledge
- Union representatives
- External industry experts

## Salience Model (Mitchell et al.)

Classifies stakeholders on three attributes:

| Attribute | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **Power** | Ability to impose will |
| **Legitimacy** | Socially accepted authority |
| **Urgency** | Time-sensitivity of claims |

**Stakeholder Types:**

| Type | Power | Legitimacy | Urgency | Strategy |
|------|-------|------------|---------|----------|
| Definitive | Yes | Yes | Yes | Top priority |
| Dominant | Yes | Yes | No | High attention |
| Dangerous | Yes | No | Yes | Handle carefully |
| Dependent | No | Yes | Yes | Protect interests |
| Discretionary | No | Yes | No | Monitor |
| Demanding | No | No | Yes | Low priority |
| Dormant | Yes | No | No | Watch |

## Attitude Overlay

Add attitude assessment to any matrix:

| Attitude | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Champion** | Active supporter | Leverage their support |

| **Neutral** | No strong opinion | Build awareness |
| **Skeptic** | Doubts but open | Address concerns |
| **Resistor** | Actively opposes | Understand and engage |
| **Blocker** | Will sabotage | Escalate or isolate |

**Combined View:**

```markdown

| CFO | High | Medium | Skeptic | Address ROI concerns |
| CTO | High | High | Champion | Leverage as sponsor |
| Users | Low | High | Supporter | Build coalition |
